## 3. System Architecture & Technology

  

The application is built on a modern, full-stack architecture designed for performance and security.

  

-  **Frontend**: A dynamic and responsive user interface built with **React**, providing a fast and engaging user experience.

-  **Backend**: A powerful and secure REST API powered by **Node.js** and **Express.js**, capable of handling a high volume of requests.

-  **Database**: Utilizes **MongoDB** with **Mongoose** for a flexible, scalable, and secure data persistence layer, ensuring data integrity and reliability.

  

## 4. Security Posture

  

Security is a core component of the system's design. The application is fortified with multiple layers of security to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.

  

-  **Secure Authentication**: Administrative access is protected by robust JWT-based authentication and password hashing using `bcryptjs`.

-  **API Protection**: The backend API is shielded by `helmet` to prevent common web vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, clickjacking), a strict `CORS` policy, and `express-rate-limit` to mitigate brute-force attacks.

-  **Data Validation**: All incoming data is rigorously validated against a schema on the server-side to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.

-  **Secure Communication**: The system is designed to operate exclusively over HTTPS to ensure all data is encrypted in transit.
